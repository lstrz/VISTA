# VISTA

VISTA (Vibrations Inherent System for Tracking and Analysis) is a payload launched on SERA-3, a sounding rocket mission flown in April 2017 from Esrange Space Center in Kiruna (Sweden), as part of the PERSEUS project.
The purpose of the VISTA payload was to record the trajectory of the rocket throughout its flight using GPS.

Essentially, it is a battery-powered Rasberry Pi Zero system reading data from a SiGe GPS RF module developed by Colorado Center of Astrodynamics Research and SiGe.
The data is stored on an SD card to be post processed on ground and calculate a trajectory of the rocket.

Hardware used (incomplete list):
 - Raspberry Pi Zero
 - SiGe GPS module
